# VR Moral Machine

In this project, I took the premise of the trolley problem and brought it into the VR world by creating a VR experience where the users will play as someone in a self-driving car.

In the actual implementation of the game, I inserted the users into several different moral dilemma experiences in the self-driving car in which they have to choose between two difficult situations e.g killing 3 men or all passengers.
